To run/test the code, you can either 
1. Download the raw "inMemoryDB.py" file from this repository and test out the function calls in the "__main__" method underneath the provided section commented as "example usage" in your python IDE of choice.
2. Clone this repository locally on your machine and test it within "inMemoryDB.py" as said above, or in a new python file you can import with ```from inMemoryDB import inMemoryDB```, and then create an instance with ```instance = inMemoryDB()```. 
(Make sure your new file using import is within the same working directory as inMemoryDB.py on your machine).

to run your tests/function calls, in any terminal cd to the working directory and run ```python .\inMemoryDB.py``` or the name of your new file instead of "inMemoryDB" if you did the second option.

To make this an official assignment, and a modification that I believe could help improve all assignments is to use a system other than google docs to convey instructions. Specifically in the listing what each function should do and when to throw errors, a design that shows an entire functions header and a comment above it with all the desired requirements would make it a lot easier to digest and understand what the instructions are. If finding a way to incorporate code and comments as function headers isn't very feasible, then an alternative could be any design that is more stylistic and organized so that instructions can be relayed clearly and effectively, with little room for misunderstanding. On another note, a cool addition could be that this assignment be split into 2, the first being this basic, barebones implementation, and the second being a way to implement this using an actual database. Ideas like this could really help not only with providing a larger sense of understanding for students, but also the more hands-on approach to understanding industry standard coding practices that this class is made to educate on.
